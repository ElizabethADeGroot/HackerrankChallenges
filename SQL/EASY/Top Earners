We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly salary x monthly worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings 
for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. 
Then print these values as 2 space-separated integers.

To solve this, I multiplied the fields salary times months to get total earnings, 
and counted the number of employees with that total earnings. I then grouped by the field earnings, orded desc so the max would be at the top
and limited to 1 so the highest would return.
--------------------------------------
SELECT salary * months AS Earnings, COUNT(employee_id)
FROM Employee
GROUP BY Earnings
ORDER BY Earnings DESC
LIMIT 1;
