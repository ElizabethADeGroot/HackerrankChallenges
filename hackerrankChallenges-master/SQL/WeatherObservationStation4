Weather Observation Station 4
Let  be the number of CITY entries in STATION, and let  be the number of distinct
CITY names in STATION; query the value of  from STATION. In other words, find the
difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of
distinct CITY entries in the table.

The STATION table is described as follows:
   ID = Number
   NAME = Varchar2 (21)
   STATE = Varchar2 (2)
   LAT_N = Number
   LONG_N = Number

note: count() will give us the total count of the records using that column. So by adding (distinct city), which will return unique city names, we are taking the total number city entries minus the number of unique cities.

MS SQL
SELECT COUNT(CITY)-COUNT(DISTINCT CITY)
FROM STATION
