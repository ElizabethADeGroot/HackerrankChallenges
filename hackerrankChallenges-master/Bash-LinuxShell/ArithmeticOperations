Arithmetic Operations
We provide you with expressions containing +,-,*,^, / and parenthesis. None of the numbers in the expression involved will exceed .
Your task is to evaluate the expression and display the correct output rounding upto  decimal places.

#!/bin/bash

printf "%.3f" $(echo "scale=4;$X" | bc)
