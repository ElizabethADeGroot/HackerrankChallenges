Compute the Average
Given  integers, compute their average correct to three decimal places.

Notes:
| bc -| (basic calculator) does not do rounding computing, hence needing printf. The "%.3f" will give you the result rounded up to 3 decimals.


==========SOLUTION========
#!/bin/bash
read n
for i in $(seq 1 $n);
    do
        read num
        sum=$((sum + num))
    done
printf "%.3f" $(echo "$sum/$n" | bc -l)
